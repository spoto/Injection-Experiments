A package containing mostly interfaces and "information-holding" classes which are needed 
for both the server and the client side of the "Public Game Server".
</p>
<p>
There is not actually much "do-something"-functionality in here - that is in webclient 
and webserver packaages. 
</p>
<p>
Contents of this package is needed both in Colossus.jar (for the client) and also
in ColossusWeb.jar (for the server).
