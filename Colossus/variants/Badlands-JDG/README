README for Colossus Badlands-JDG Variant

This sub-variant further extends the Badlands variant.  
John David Galt created new alternate maps for the terrains 
that didn't get any in the original Badlands.

See: http://www.diogenes.sacramento.ca.us/titan_lands.html

As with the main Badlands variant, Colossus currently assigns
which masterboard hexes get the variant battle maps 
statically rather than randomly.  We may change this someday.
