README for Beelzebub v0.2 alpha 2
A variant by Chris Byler and Jay Delanoy

This variant is an attempt to combine the best features of the
Abyssal, Extended and Undead variants, with a careful eye on
the balance of the recruiting trees.

Major changes:
1. Brush/Jungle track replaced with undead.  Tombs and Circle battlelands 
now have Stones (tombstones) instead of Trees.  Shades, Ghosts, Spectres, 
Phantoms and Wraiths can enter Stones and have a native bonus there - 
non-native attackers lose a Skill factor.  Both tracks lead up to Death, 
who is a unique 16-3 flying summonable lord.  Death can recruit down in 
two terrains (to Liches and Mummies), but since he is unique he cannot
recruit more of himself.  Liches and Wraiths are the only recruitable 
magic rangestrikers (except for Beelzebub, see below).

2. New creatures added to the tops of most recruiting trees.  Unicorns
and Hydras moved further up their trees and now only native to one
terrain, but their abilities have been improved (greatly so for
Unicorns).  Colossi now only native to mountains - 2 Giants in Tundra 
now get a Mammoth (24-2).

3. Masterboard considerably rearranged.  Some Hills/Woods moved to the
outer ring ("bus").

4. Some creature stats added, and recruiting trees modified.

5. New terrain type: Hellmouth.  Any legion on a Hellmouth can recruit
an Imp.  Otherwise the recruiting ladder is 2 Imps, 3 Devils, 2 Fiends, 
Beelzebub.  Beelzebub is a unique summonable 13-4 flying magic 
rangestriking lord.  If killed he can be recruited again.  The Hellmouth 
is an unpleasant place to defend, although not quite as harsh as in 
Abyssal.  Note that Devils can also be earned on points for battles won
in Tombs, Ruins or Hellmouth, and Devils, Fiends and Beelzebub are all
summonable.  Beelzebub can also be recruited by 2 Wraiths in a Circle.

6. Many new earned creatures - elementals, spectres, devils and
archdevils, mages, archmages and phantoms.  Elementals, spectres and
phantoms get native bonuses in their respective terrains.  Devils, 
archdevils, archmages and phantoms are summonable, but elementals, 
spectres and mages are not.  Archdevils, archmages and phantoms are 
also lords (they can tower teleport and are immune to normal 
rangestrikes).

7. Titans are skill 4, gain power every 100 points and Titan Teleport
at 600 points.

8. Warlocks have been eliminated.  Mages and Archmages must be earned 
on points for battles fought in Towers, Hellmouths or Circles.  However, 
they are both more powerful than Warlocks.  Titans no longer get any 
special recruit.

9. Alpha 2 changes: Wraiths 12*!3, Mummies 18-2, 3 Ghost->Wraith,
2 Wraith->Beelzebub, replaced Efreet with Djinn (6*|4, native to sand,
dunes and slopes), fixed some errors in the readme.
