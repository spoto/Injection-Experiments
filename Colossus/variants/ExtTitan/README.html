    <h2>What are ExtTitan and Extended Titan ?</h2>
    
    Extended Titan is an extension to regular Avalon Hill Titan, designed by
    Guy Dyson. ExtTitan is a variant pack to allow Colossus players to play 
    Extended Titan.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>What are the differences with regular Titan ?</h3>
    
    New creatures, some old creatures are stronger, new recruiting and
    acquiring tables, and bigger masterboard.  See the pages cited above
    for more details.<p>
      
     <em> Note:</em> ExtTitan has been updated to a more recent version of
      Extended Titan, that wasn't published on the web.<p>
      
      According to author Guy Dyson, the new changes
      (as of early December 2002) are:

    <ul>
      <li>Serpents gain 3 dice
      <li>Manticores gain tree nativity
      <li>Griffons lose range strike, but gain tree nativity
      <li>Unicorns gain a dice
      <li>Also the caretaker stack sizes have all been increased
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What are the differences between Extended Titan and ExtTitan ?</h3>
    
    We do not yet support the Ent or Balrog optional rules.  Otherwise they
    should now be identical.  If not, please report the bug.<p>
    
    <h3>(OBSOLETE) Graphics are ugly or wrong!</h3>
    
    Not anymore. Thanks to Jerry Reiger for the chits for the new and
    changed creatures, and to Josh Smith and John Lum for the Orange
    and Purple markers.<p>
    
    <h3>(OBSOLETE) Why is the Griffon Rangestriking ?</h3>
    
    Guy Dyson (author of Extended Titan) and James Gwinnett (playtester)
    confirm that they gave griffons rangestriking because wyverns gained
    slope nativity when they became recruitable in hills, and they wanted
    to create a balancing advantage for griffons.  (There is no real
    advantage to being native to woods.)<p>

      <em>Note:</em> as of early December 2002, the Griffon no longer
      rangestrike, but is native to Tree instead.<p>
