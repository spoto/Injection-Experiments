<h1>README for Colossus Variant Unified</h1>
         
<h2>What is Unified Titan?</h2>
Unified Titan is an extended version of basic Titan that attempts to add
to the original Avalon Hill Titan.<p>
It has lot of similarities with the Abyssal variants, but also adds a 
series of skill-5 dragons and undead creatures.

<h2>What has changed with the Titan?</h2>
The Titan is now a skill-factor 5 piece. This yields automatic hits
against skill-factor 2 pieces. A Titan gains Titan-Teleport at 1000
points. He still gains a hit-point every 100 points 
and&nbsp;acquires&nbsp;an Archangel at 500 points an Angel at 100 
points, but alternatively can acquire a Green Dragon at 100 points.
<br>
<h2>What has changed on the Battlelands?</h2>
 The Battlelands for Brush, Jungle, Plains, Marsh, Hills, Woods, Desert,
 Swamp, Mountains, and Tundra are as in the default game.
<br>
<h2>What has changed with the original creatures?</h2>
 Other than the Titan, none of the original creatures has had their stats
 changed, or how they are recruited. Original creatures do have new recruiting
 options in their native terrains.<br>
         
<h2>What are the new creatures and how are they recruited?</h2>
Unified combines several ideas of recruiting lines - something like in 
the Abyssal variants, some undead creatures, and a bunch of 
differently&nbsp;colored dragons.

<h3>Dragon? What's a Dragon?</h3>
 Unified Titan adds Dragons to the Creatures. Dragons can be recruited
 when in one of the 4 Dragon Keeps, colored dark grey, on the
 masterboard.<br>
<br>
A Green Dragon is a 5-5 creature, and is recruited by any other creature
in the keep.<br>
A Blue Dragon is a 7-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Green Dragon.<br>
A Purple Dragon is a 9-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Blue Dragon.<br>
A Silver Dragon is an 11-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Purple Dragon.<br>
A Black Dragon is a 13-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Silver Dragon.<br>
A Gold Dragon is a 15-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Black Dragon.<br>
A Red Dragon is a 17-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Gold Dragon.<br>
A Balrog is a 20-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Red Dragon.<br>
<br>
All Dragons and the Balrog are flying rangestrikers, native on slopes and
in volcanos.<br>
<br>
Note: Because of the use of Dragons, the Magog has replaced the Dragon in
the Colossus recruiting tree in the Mountains, but it is identical to the
Dragon in Default Titan, 9-3 Flying Range striker, etc. 

<h3>What does it have to do with Abyssal variants?</h3>
Quite some recruit options are similar as in Abyssal6 and Abyssal9, with the
difference that Wasteland was added. Wasteland is very similar to Jungle,
but all formerly Plains hexes are now Bramble, and allows it different
recruiting.<br>
<br>
    3 Gorgons recruit 1 Manticore in the Brush. 
      A Manticore is a flying rangestriker, 8-3.<br>
    2 Cyclops can recruit a Behemoth in the Wasteland.<br>
    3 Behemoth recruit 1 Jabberwok in the Wasteland. A Jabberwok is a 27-2.<br>
<br>
    2 Rangers recruit 1 Salamander in the Marsh. A Salamander is an 8-3.<br>
    2 Unicorns recruit 1 Ent in the Woods. An Ent is a 12-3. <br>
    2 Hydrae recruit 1 Chimera in the Desert. A Chimera is a 16-3.<br>
    2 Colossi recruit 1 Mammoth in the Tundra. A Mammoth is a 20-3.<br>
<br>
   3 Rangers recruit 1 Air Elemental in the Plains.
     An Air Elemental is a 5-4 flying magic-missiler.<br>
   3 Unicorns recruit 1 Earth Elemental in the Hills.
     An Earth Elemental is an 8-4 flying magic-missiler. <br>
   3 Hydra recruit 1 Water Elemental in the Swamp.
     A Water Elemental is an 11-4 flying magic-missiler.<br>
   3 Colossi recruit 1 Fire Elemental in the Mountains.
     A Fire Elemental is a 14-4 flying magic-missiler.<br>
<br>Note: Unlike Abyssal, 3 Fire Elementals do not recuit a Balrog. The 
Balrog in Unified is a ("normal") flying rangestriker (not magic-missiler, 
and cannot be summoned).

<h3>Undead? What's Undead?</h3>
</h2>
 Unified Titan also has Undead Creatures. Undead Creatures mirror Brush/Jungle
Creatures completely, except that they have 1 extra skill factor. Instead
of being recruited in the Brush, Jungle, Wasteland they are recruited in
the Graveyard, Tombs, and Abyss which are drift based battleboards.<br>
<br>
Any Creature can recruit a Skeleton in the Castle, a 4-4 flying piece.<br>
2 Skeletons recruit a Zombie, 9-3, in the Graveyard.<br>
2 Zombies recruit a Lich, 6-4 flying rangestriker, in the Graveyard.<br>
3 Liches recruit a Necromancer, 8-4 flying rangestriker, in the Graveyard.<br>
<br>
2 Skeletons recruit a Zombie, 9-3, in the Tombs.<br>
3 Zombies recruit a Wraith, 8-4, in the Tombs.<br>
2 Wraiths recruit a Vampire, 18-3, in the Tombs.<br>
<br>
2 Zombies recruit a Wraith in the Abyss, 8-4 in the Abyss.<br>
3 Wraiths recruit a Reaper, 27-3, in the Abyss.
<br>
<h2>What about the Masterboard, there seems to be a lot of new terrains?</h2>
    The Masterboard is almost identical to the original board, except new
half-circles containing keeps, castles, wastelands, tombs, and Abyss, are
all appended outside of the "bus"; half of the brushes on the "bus" have
been replaced with Graveyards.
         
<h2>Who is responsible for Unified Titan?&nbsp;</h2>
 Abyssal6 Titan was originally created by David Newell. Eric Nielsen helped
 a great deal with balance-testing, and inspiration. Together the two of
 them have tried to break Titan by changing the rules hundreds of times, rarely 
 succeeding. They would like to thank the original creators of Titan at Avalon 
 Hill for creating a superb game that has given them thousands of hours of 
 enjoyment. Also to be thanked are John Crowe, for introducing them to the 
 game, Nate Houle, for being a frequent play-partner and an extremely tough 
 opponent, the development team of Colossus for doing a wonderful adaptation
 of Titan and making many custom changes to the code that made Abyssal Titan
 possible, and Dave Wall, for during his first game of Titan, actually 
 believing a player had to make the sound of the creature he was recruiting, 
 forever imortalizing the Ogre as an "Uunga-Bunga."
