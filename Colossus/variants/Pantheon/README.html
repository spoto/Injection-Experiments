<H1>README for Colossus Variant Pantheon (Version 1.0)</H1>
<H2>What is Pantheon Titan?</H2>
<P>Pantheon Titan is an extended version of basic Titan that attempts to add to the original Avalon Hill Titan. </P>
<H2>What has changed with the Titan?</H2>
<P>A Titan gains Titan-Teleport at 1000 points. He still recruits an Angel at 100 points, Archangel at 500 points, and gains a hit-point every 100 points.  Angels and Archangels CANNOT BE SUMMONED.</P>
<H2>What has changed on the Battlelands?</H2>
<P>The Battlelands for Brush, Jungle, Plains, Marsh, Hills, Woods, Desert, Swamp, Mountains, and Tundra have all been changed. They are all more severe, giving more advantage to native creatures. In addition, Hills, Bog, Bramble, and Drift have been added to new Battlelands in order to spice things up a bit. It is the same as in the Abyssal version except that Abyss is called Mantio (oracle).</P>
<H2>What are the new creatures and how are they recruited?</H2>
<P>The new brunch of creatures in Mantio are: </P>
<P>Titan recruit 1 Druid (3-4 magical rangestriker)<BR>
1 Druid recruit 1 Knight (7-3)<BR>
1 Knight recruit 1 Priest (10-3 magical rangestriker)<BR>
2 Priest recruit Estia (God same as Lord)</P>
<P>12 Olympian Gods exist in the game plus the God of Underwold Hades,
and the reckless God Dionysous.
They are unique, battle-summonable lords, recruitable in Mantio under this conditions:</P>
<ul>
<li>3 Colossus recruit Zeus (15 4 magical rangestriker)</li>
<li>2 Colossus recruit Hera (18 3 flyer)</li>
<li>2 Hydras recruit Hepfaestus (20 2)</li>
<li>3 Hydras recruit Poseidon (15 3)</li>
<li>3 Unicorns recruit Ares (13 3)</li>
<li>2 Unicorns recruit Dimitra (11 3)</li>
<li>3 Rangers recruit Aphrodite (6 4 flyer)</li>
<li>4 Rangers recruit Apollo (7 4 rangestriker)</li>
<li>3 Gorgons recruit Hermes (9 3 flyer)</li>
<li>4 Gorgons recruit Dionysous (10 3 flyer, rangestriker)</li>
<li>2 Serpents recruit Artemis (16 3 rangestriker)</li>
<li>3 Colossus recruit Estia (9 4)</li>
<li>4 Warlock recruit Athena (10 4)</li>
<li>4 Guardian recruit Athena (10 4)</li>
<li>4 Lords recruit Hades (13 4 magical rangestriker)</li>
</ul>
<P>&nbsp;Important! 2 Cyclops recruit Behemoth in Jungle (a kind of compensation).</P>
<H2>What is the Mantio?</H2>
<P>The Mantio is also some kind of Anti-Tower. On the main board it is colored Pink. The battleboard is an upside-down Tower, with the "FREAR"(well) covered in drift. The defender starts in the walled-in drift. A powerful stack should be attacked when in the Mantio, whenever possible, as it is extremely vulnerable (SAME as ABYSS). </P>
<p>
<b>Note that those Gods cannot recruit down</b> - e.g. Apollo cannot
recruit Rangers. (This is same as in Tower: 3 of any kind can recruit a
Guardian, but with Guardian you cannot recruit anything else than another
guardian; the three tower creatures are a special case, they can be
recruited with really antything anyway, as long as the legion is not empty.)
</p>

<H2>What about the Masterboard?&nbsp;</H2>
<P>The Masterboard is almost identical to the original board, except all of the Jungle not in the "bus" has been removed; and similar as in Abyssal the non-bus Jungles are Abyss, they are here Mantio.</P>
<H2>Who is responsible for Pantheon Titan?&nbsp;</H2>
<P>Sakis Spyropoulos is the creator inspired by the Greek Gods!
It is obvious the game is a struggle to gain a God or more to help you
fighting and winning battles in difficult terrains. 
For this reason the Angel and Archangel are not summonable in battle but only
help you to gain the second in power God Hades. It is fun because a God is
unique and helps only one player at a time - if you lose him, he might help 
your opponent! (Something quite usual in ancient Greek Mythology).</P>
<P>Thanks to C.S.Raftopoulos this text has been written and a basic
playtesting has been done.</P>
