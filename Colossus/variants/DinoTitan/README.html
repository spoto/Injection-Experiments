<H1>README for Colossus DinoTitan Variant</H1>

<H2>What is DinoTitan ?</H2>

DinoTitan is an extended version of basic Titan that attempts to add to the original Avalon Hill Titan. <p>

<H2>What has changed with the Terrain? </H2>
Two new Terrain types have been added.  TarPits are hexes that have a slowing effect on creatures.  The tar 
sticks to the creatures and slows them for the duration of the battle.  Slowing is cumulative, removing another
factor from the creatures movement for each turn spent in the TarPit, so creatures can become stuck there.
Springs are natural spring hexes that have a healing effect.  Creatures in a Spring heal 1 hit per turn, and,
if slowed by a TarPit, wash off one factor of slowing each turn in the Spring.

<H2>What has changed with the Battlelands? </H2>
All of the Battlelands have changed from the basic version.  Most of the Battlelands are taken from the Abyssal
variant.  Wastelands are taken from the Unified variant.  In addition, there are two new Battlelands, Lava
and Springs, and TarPits and Springs have been added to some of the existing Battlelands.
 
<H2>What about the Masterboard?</H2>
 This large map is based on the Outlands map, using the same shape and linkages.. 
The placement of land types is new, and as mentioned above, there are some new Battlelands added.

<H2>What has changed with the original creatures? </H2>
Angels, Titans, Guardians and Warlocks are still available.  The rest of the original creatures are not used
in DinoTitan.

<H2>What has changed with the Titan? </H2>
The Titan is now a skill-factor 5 piece. This yields automatic hits against skill-factor 2 pieces. A Titan 
gains Titan-Teleport at 1000 points. He can aquire an Angel or Crocodile at 100 points, Archangel at 500 points, 
and gains a hit-point every 100 points.

<H2>What new creatures features have been added?</H2>
Some creatures now have the ability to poison creatures they strike.  A creature that has been poisoned takes one damage each strike phase, much as a non-native creature in a Drift hex does.  A poisoned creature remains poisoned throughout the battle.  Poisoned creatures in a Springs hex are cured of the poisoning.

<H2>Who is responsible for DinoTitan?</H2>
The original concept for DinoTitan, and the creature artwork was done by Greg Partridge.  Design and implementation were done by David Partridge.  Many thanks to Jason McAllister and David Trampier for a timeless game and to Clemens Katzer for supporting and encouraging involvement in the Colossus project.
