README for Colossus Badlands Variant

1) What is Badlands ?

Badlands is an extension to regular Titan, the game
from Avalon Hill upon which Colossus is based. It
is also a variant pack to allow Colossus player to
play (a close approximation of) Badlands.
See <http://www.cheewai.com/titan/variants_badlands.asp>,
for more details and the original copyright on Badlands.

Badlands was implemented in Colossus by Romain Dolbeau <romain@dolbeau.org>

2) What are the differences with regular Titan ?

New Battlelands for some terrains.

3) What are the differences between the original Badlands
and Badlands in Colossus ?

In the original Badlands, Battlelands were used randomly
when multiple Battlelands were available. In the current
implementation for Colossus, alternate Battlelands are
distributed statically on the strategic map. The alternate
Tundra is not used, as there is only a small, odd number
of Tundra on the masterboard.

This difference is due to technical limitations in Colossus,
it might be lifted in the future :-)
