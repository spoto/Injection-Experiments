<h2>What is Infinite?</h2>
Infinite is a variant with only 3 changes. First, the Titan has a skill factor
of three. Second, the game starts with 999 creatures in all of the caretaker's
stacks. Third, all movement arrows have been replaced by a single arrow,
allowing for much more movement on the masterboard.
