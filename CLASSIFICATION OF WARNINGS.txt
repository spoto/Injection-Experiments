Each project has been analyzed and the set of warnings is reported in the
corresponding .txt file. There, each warning has been classified as:

TA: true alarm
TA2: true alarm that uses a two-level flow of information: first from tainted sources into a database, later from the database into sinks
FA: false alarm
FA?: classification was impossible for this. We conservatively counted it as a false alarm
