/**
 * Class which controls the in game clock.
 * 
 * The in game clock is based on the realtime clock. When a new Clock is created
 * without any arguments the current time and a multiplier of 1 is used. The
 * multiplier defines the rate at which in game time advances in comparison to
 * the real time. Through the use of a saved offset and the multiplier the in
 * game time also advances when the game is not running, forcing people run the
 * game often enough to get the maximum out of it.
